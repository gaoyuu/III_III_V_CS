1) What are specs of the board you are using (ex. Speed, RAM, Flash)?

board: Cortex-M4
Speed: 72 MHz
RAM: up to 48 -Kbyte SRAM
flash: 64- to 256- Kbyte


2) What does GPIO stand for?

General-Purpose Input/Output

3) Is the provided delay function accurate? Why or why not?

I think it is not. The delay time depends on the execute speed of different computers.

4) What are the Port and Pin Numbers of the two Green LEDs?

Pin: E
Number: 11 and 15

5) What are the public attributes of the GPIO_InitTypeDef Struct?

unit32_t		GPIO_Pin
GPIOMode_TypeDef	GPIO_Mode
GPIOSpeed_TypeDef	GPIO_Speed
GPIOPuPe_TypeDef	GPIO_PuPd
GPIOOType_TypeDef	GPIO_OType

Difficulties:
It was quite new for me to see the graph illustrating the board, I could not find

how to link each port.

I also did not get what the functions of those attributes are.

But when I went deep step by step, I figured out these confusions.
