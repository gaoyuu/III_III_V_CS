Q1. What is the significance of the peripheral base address? Where does it point? 

Its the address of prephrial that is being used by DMA, it points to thedata from the prephrial.

Q2. Why is it necessary to enable incrementing as was done in this step? What will the DMA controller do in response to this configuration.

It can access the data as reading through an array, go to each new memory location, you do this if you need to read data from more than one DR register

Q3. Why is this line of the code necessary?

This code is waiting for a completion flag to be passed.

Q4. For transfers of less than 4 bytes, what do you think is the reason for not using the xchng_datablock functions?

DMA makes it more efficient to operate on less than 4 bytes.

difficulties: quite can not fingure out what do the "new" codes do.
