Q1) The accelerometer/magnetometer comes pre-wired on the STM board. Open up the the Data Sheet and find the page with the Pin Descriptions. How many pins does it have? 
14pins, 2.5 V

Q2) Why do we write to the accelerometer/magnetometer before we can read from them? What are the following lines of code doing?
because we want i2c to control the specific registerbefore reading the data.

Q3) What do the following lines of code do? (it is only necessary to explain the accelerometer)
the for loop is reading x,y,z axis acceloraometer data  from the buffer by shifting bits.

Q4) Why might it be necessary to tilt compensate your compass computation?
