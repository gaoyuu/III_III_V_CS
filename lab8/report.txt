Q1) The accelerometer/magnetometer comes pre-wired on the STM board. Open up the the Data Sheet and find the page with the Pin Descriptions. How many pins does it have? 
14pins, 2.5 V

Q2) Why do we write to the accelerometer/magnetometer before we can read from them? What are the following lines of code doing?

Because we want I2c contoller to control the specific register before reading the data.

Q3) What do the following lines of code do? (it is only necessary to explain the accelerometer)

for loop reads the data y shifting bits, and store them in accel_data array.

Q4) Why might it be necessary to tilt compensate your compass computation?

I think the pitch and roll may affect the accuracy of the compass,or there might be errors displaying compass
