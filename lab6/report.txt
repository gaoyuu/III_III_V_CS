What does the CS pin do (the CS pin is called SS in the lab manual)?
It is used to enable the correct device for communication.

Why do you set the CS high at the end of the pin initializations? What other functions in f3d_gyro.c change CS from low to high or high to low?
Because it is easy to communicate with low ones.

read&&write function also use set high

How do you hook up multiple peripherals on one SPI bus?
To talk to a particular slave, the slaveâ€™s SS line should keep low and the rest of them should be high.
Lots of slaves will require lots of SS lines
For MISO, connect to the MOSI of the next. In this case, a single SS line goes to all the slaves.

The STM has an Operating Frequency of 72 MHz. When initializing SPI1, what do you set the baud rate prescaler to? What is the resulting SPI clock frequency?
A prescalar of 8 results in a 3MHz SPI clock.
we use prescaler of 64, 8, and 2 for slow, medium and fast speeds.

Does a peripheral (slave) need to be configured with the transmission speed before it can communicate with the microcontroler (master)? Why would you want to be able to do on-the-fly changes in transmission speed?
Yes.
Because I need to see the changes in clearly.


Describe what you learned and any difficulties you had :
I have learned differences between unsigned numbers and two's complement numbers and how 
to operate on two's complement numbers.
